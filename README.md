# graphics

Set of apps implementing various computer graphics methods with step-by-step execution option. Sorry for russian language in sources which 
was encoded badly.

Contents:
 1) line drawing algorithms - DDA, Bresenham, Woo. Draw by drag-n-drop.
 2) curves: hyperbola
 3) curves: Hermite, Bézier, B-spline. Put four dots, then drag the dots to change the curve.
 4) polygon filling algorithms. Mark vertices of polygon, then hit Enter to fill.
 5) Cyrus–Beck clipping algorithm: draw a polygon first by marking its vertices, then draw lines by drag-n-drop. Turn the clipping on or off using button in toolbar, move clipping polygon by dragging it by its vertices. Normals are rendered as well.
